      {/* <p className="text-base">
        I am a software engineer by profession with more than 4 years of
        experience, primarily focused on front-end web development. My
        fascination on how websites are built started when I was in grade
        school, sparking my interest of being a web developer. I simply started
        building webpages with basic HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript
        &#40;yes, I hated it. I just wanted to play with styling&#41; I thought
        it wasn't required too much until I realized it plays a large role in
        making a website interactive.
        <br />
        Fast-forward, when I was in the university, I really enjoyed Javascript
        among all the programming languages that have been taught to us. I
        helped in building a registration site for an event we organized as a
        batch until it continued to our thesis project.
